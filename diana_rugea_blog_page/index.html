    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
    <p><em>Posted Thursday, 19th of October, 2023</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>I am 27 years old and I'm from Oradea, Romania. I have recently moved back home after living in London, UK for
      almost 8 years. Although I have always kept busy with work and studies, I always find the time to learn new
      things.
    <p><strong>If I could choose 3 of my favourite activites to do, these would be:</strong></strong> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sports & Fitness</li>
      <li>Video Gaming</li>
      <li>Nature Walking</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>1. Sports & Fitness</h3>
    <p>Last week I took an online course about Yoga, which was really interesting, since I didn't know much about it. I
      always took classes but I've never taken the time to actually learn about it. </p>
 
    <ul>
      <h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
      <li>Yoga is a meditative process of self-discovery and liberation. It is a diverse collection of practices that
        aims
        to control the mind, recognize a detached witness consciousness, and free oneself from the cycle of birth and
        death. It teaches us to see ourselves clearly, to understand what is true about who we are, and to let go of
        anything that does not serve us. It helps us to become aware of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, and to
        change
        them when they no longer serve us. It gives us the tools to make better choices in life, and to live more fully.

        Yoga is a practice that allows us to transform and purify our bodies, minds, and souls. It expands our
        consciousness to help us connect with nature and the universe around us. It also gives us greater access to
        inner
        resources to teach us about self-awareness, acceptance, compassion, patience, gratitude, forgiveness, humility,
        love, peace, and joy.</li>
      <h3>Best Practices of Yoga</h3>
      <li><strong>Yama</strong> – The moral codes of conduct
      <li><strong>Niyama</strong> – The physical observances and internal practices</li>
      <li><strong>Asana</strong> – The proper posture</li>
      <li><strong>Pranayama</strong> – The proper breathing exercises</li>
      <li><strong>Pratyahara</strong>– The withdrawal of senses from external distractions</li>
      <li><strong>Dharana</strong> - The mental concentration and focusing the mind</li>
      <li><strong>Dhyana</strong> - The meditation and focus on a single point</li>
      <li><strong>Samadhi</strong> - The cessation of all mental activity to attain a state of oneness</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h3>Types of Yoga</h3>
      <li>Raja <em>(the royal path)</em> – focuses on meditation practices</li>
      <li>Karma <em>(the path of action)</em> – focuses on action and service in daily life</li>
      <li>Jnana <em>(the path of knowledge)</em> – focuses on discriminative wisdom and self inquiry</li>
      <li>Bhakti <em>(the path of devotion)</em> – focuses on devotion to God</li>
      <li>Tantra <em>(the path of ecstasy</em> ) – focuses on ritual and initiation</li>
      <li>Hatha <em>(the forceful path)</em> – focuses on energy and movement of the body
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Favourite Video Games</h3>
    <p>Most video games are fun and engaging. Gaming produces a release of dopamine (the happy hormone) which will make
      you feel good and help you cope with the stresses of everyday life.</p>
